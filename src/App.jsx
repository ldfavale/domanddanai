              A Dutch and a Canadian Who fell in love in Uruguay.
              </h2>
              <p className='font-now text-sm  text-gray-400'> We both left our lives in The Netherlands and Canada in 2022 and started a new adventure in Uruguay. We met in a small local church and his family invited her over for lunch. We had so many things in common and it immediately felt like weâ€™ve been friends for years. It was the start of a good friendship.
                  Throughout the rest of the summer we became better friends and could talk for hours about combined interests. Despite that, our lovestory began after summer. The funny thing is that both of our families met each other before we fell in love. Little did we know we would all become family very soon after that.
                  We both knew we wanted to spent the rest of our lives together and the rest is history. </p>
